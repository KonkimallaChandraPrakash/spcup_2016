	Right end to plug point
	Other end to laptop or any arduino data collecting device
	Circuit is to convert 9 Volt supply to 5 Volt supply
	Arduino Uno(or higher) or should be able to send serially at 1khz or higher
	
# Example ".wav" files
You can find example ".wav" files in "Our Recordings" folder
